# User Access Review Procedure (AC-PROC-003)

### 1. Purpose

To define the process for conducting periodic reviews of user access rights to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all user accounts with access to company information systems and the managers or system owners responsible for those accounts.

### 3. Overview

This procedure describes the process for conducting periodic access reviews to ensure users maintain only the access necessary for their current role. Review frequencies are tailored based on access privileges: quarterly reviews for accounts with privileged or administrative access, and semi-annual reviews for all other standard user accounts. Regular reviews help maintain the principle of least privilege and support SOC 2 compliance.
