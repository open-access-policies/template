# Application Security Testing Procedure (ENG-PROC-001)

### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to detail the process for conducting static application security testing (SAST), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and penetration testing to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in applications.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all company-developed applications that process or store sensitive customer data.

### 3. Overview

This procedure outlines the security testing requirements for applications, including automated security scans integrated into the development process and periodic security assessments to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
