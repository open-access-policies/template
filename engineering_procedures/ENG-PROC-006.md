# Privileged Infrastructure Access Review Procedure (ENG-PROC-006)

### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to outline the steps for conducting and documenting the required quarterly reviews of all user accounts with privileged access to production infrastructure, ensuring the principle of least privilege is maintained.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all user accounts, service accounts, and roles with administrative or privileged access to any production system, database, or network component.

### 3. Overview

This procedure describes the quarterly access review process. It begins with the Security Team generating a list of privileged accounts, which is then distributed to system owners for review. Managers attest to the continued need for each access right. Any unnecessary access is then revoked, and the completed attestations are stored for audit purposes.

| **1**    | Security Team                | On a quarterly basis, generates a report from the identity and access management system listing all users and service accounts with privileged access to production infrastructure. |
| **2**    | Security Team                | Sends the access report to the relevant system owners or managers responsible for the systems listed.                                                              |
| **3**    | System Owner / Manager       | Reviews each user's access rights on the report and attests in writing (e.g., via a signed form or an approval in a tracking ticket) that the access is still required for their job function. |
| **4**    | IT Team / System Administrator | Upon notification from the manager or Security Team, revokes any access that is no longer necessary or has been denied during the review.                          |
| **5**    | Security Team                | Collects and stores the completed, signed attestations as an audit record of the quarterly review.                                                                 |
