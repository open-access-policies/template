# Encryption and Key Management Policy (OP-POL-001)

### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish requirements for the secure configuration and use of cloud-native encryption and key management services at **[Company Name]**. This policy ensures that sensitive information is protected through appropriate cloud encryption technologies and that cryptographic keys are securely managed using cloud provider key management services in compliance with SOC 2 requirements.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members, contractors, and third parties who configure, access, or manage cloud encryption services and encrypted information. It encompasses all cloud-based information systems, applications, databases, storage services, and communication channels containing sensitive data. This policy covers cloud encryption services across all approved cloud platforms including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and SaaS applications.

### 3. Policy

**[Company Name]** shall utilize cloud-native encryption and key management services to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of sensitive information throughout its lifecycle.

**3.1 Cloud Encryption Requirements**

Encryption shall be implemented using cloud provider native services for all sensitive information based on data classification levels.

**Confidential Data Requirements:**
- **Data at rest:** Encrypted using cloud provider encryption services (e.g., AWS S3 Server-Side Encryption, Azure Storage Service Encryption, GCP Cloud Storage encryption)
- **Data in transit:** Encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher with cloud provider managed certificates
- **Database encryption:** Implemented using cloud provider database encryption services (e.g., AWS RDS encryption, Azure SQL TDE, GCP Cloud SQL encryption)
- **Application data:** Encrypted using cloud provider application-level encryption services
- **Backup encryption:** Enabled for all cloud backup and archive services

**Authentication and Access:**
- **Identity management:** Leverages cloud provider identity services with MFA enforcement
- **API access:** Secured using cloud provider managed API keys and tokens
- **Service accounts:** Protected using cloud provider service account key management

**3.2 Cloud-Native Key Management**

All cryptographic keys shall be managed using cloud provider key management services rather than manual key management processes.

**Required Cloud Key Management Services:**
- **AWS:** AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for Customer Managed Keys (CMK)
- **Azure:** Azure Key Vault for customer-managed encryption keys
- **Google Cloud:** Google Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS) for Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
- **Multi-cloud:** HashiCorp Vault or equivalent for cross-cloud key management when required

**Key Management Requirements:**
- **Customer-managed keys:** Used for all production data containing Confidential information
- **Key rotation:** Configured within cloud provider console with automated annual rotation or as recommended by cloud provider
- **Access control:** Managed through cloud provider Identity and Access Management (IAM) with least privilege principles
- **Audit logging:** Enabled for all key management activities using cloud provider audit services

**3.3 Cloud Provider Configuration Standards**

Cloud encryption services shall be configured according to cloud provider security best practices and industry benchmarks.

**Configuration Requirements:**
- **Default encryption:** Enabled by default for all applicable cloud services
- **Strong algorithms:** Use cloud provider default encryption algorithms (typically AES-256)
- **Regional compliance:** Ensure key storage and processing occurs in approved geographic regions
- **Service integration:** Configure encryption to work seamlessly with other cloud services

**Security Benchmarks:**
- **AWS:** Configure services according to CIS Benchmarks for AWS
- **Azure:** Follow Azure Security Benchmark recommendations
- **Google Cloud:** Implement Google Cloud Security Best Practices
- **Regular assessment:** Quarterly review of cloud encryption configurations against current benchmarks

**3.4 Access Control and Monitoring**

Access to cloud key management services shall be strictly controlled and monitored.

**Access Requirements:**
- **IAM integration:** All access managed through cloud provider IAM systems
- **Role-based access:** Implement cloud provider recommended key management roles
- **MFA enforcement:** Required for all access to key management services
- **Separation of duties:** Key administration separated from data administration roles

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
- **Cloud audit logs:** Enable comprehensive logging for all key management activities
- **Automated alerts:** Configure cloud provider monitoring to alert on unauthorized key access
- **Regular review:** Monthly review of key access logs and quarterly access certification

### 4. Standards Compliance

This policy is designed to comply with and support the following industry standards and regulations.

|**Policy Section**|**Standard/Framework**|**Control Reference**|
|---|---|---|
|**3.1, 3.3**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.1 - Logical Access Security|
|**3.4, 3.5**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.6 - Other Controls to Achieve Logical Access Security|
|**3.3**|SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria|CC6.8 - Restricts Access to Encrypted Data|

### 5. Definitions

**Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK):** Encryption keys that are created and managed by the customer within cloud provider key management services.

**Cloud Key Management Service:** Cloud provider native services for creating, managing, and controlling access to cryptographic keys (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud KMS).

**Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Cloud provider services for managing user identities and controlling access to cloud resources.

**Security Benchmark:** Industry-standard configuration guidelines for securing cloud services (e.g., CIS Benchmarks, cloud provider security best practices).
